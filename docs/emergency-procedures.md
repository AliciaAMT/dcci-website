# Emergency Procedures - DCCI Ministries Website

## 🚨 Critical Situation Response

This guide provides step-by-step procedures for handling critical situations with the DCCI Ministries website. **Follow these procedures exactly** to minimize downtime and data loss.

## 🆘 Website Down - Immediate Response

### **Step 1: Assess the Situation (0-5 minutes)**
- [ ] **Check if you can access the website**
- [ ] **Verify the error type** (404, 500, connection refused, etc.)
- [ ] **Check if it's affecting all users or just you**
- [ ] **Note the exact time the issue started**

### **Step 2: Quick Diagnostics (5-15 minutes)**
```bash
# Check if the domain resolves
nslookup your-domain.com

# Check if the server responds
curl -I https://your-domain.com

# Check Firebase console for errors
# Go to: console.firebase.google.com
```

### **Step 3: Immediate Actions (15-30 minutes)**
1. **Check Firebase Console**:
   - Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com)
   - Select "dcci-ministries" project
   - Check for error messages or service disruptions

2. **Check Cloudflare Dashboard**:
   - Go to [Cloudflare Dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com)
   - Look for any active incidents or errors

3. **Verify Domain Status**:
   - Check your domain provider's status page
   - Verify DNS settings haven't changed

### **Step 4: Communication (30 minutes)**
- **Notify Ministry Owner**: Send immediate update
- **Social Media**: Post status update if applicable
- **Team Communication**: Alert relevant team members

## 🔥 Firebase Service Disruption

### **Firebase Hosting Down**
```bash
# Check Firebase status
firebase status

# Verify project configuration
firebase projects:list

# Check hosting configuration
firebase hosting:channel:list
```

### **Firestore Database Issues**
1. **Check Firestore Rules**:
   - Verify security rules haven't changed
   - Check for syntax errors in rules

2. **Database Performance**:
   - Monitor query performance
   - Check for rate limiting

3. **Data Integrity**:
   - Verify recent backups
   - Check for data corruption

### **Firebase Authentication Issues**
1. **Check Auth Configuration**:

## Nuclear Lockdown (last resort)

Nuclear lockdown is an emergency switch in **Admin Dashboard → Site Management** (`/admin/emergency-controls`).

### What it does

When `nuclearLockdown` is `true` on Firestore document `siteSettings/emergency`:

- **All** site access is blocked, including admins (guards send people to maintenance)
- New admin **signups** are blocked
- Content writes and most client writes are blocked
- The admin UI **cannot** turn it off (toggle is disabled)

### Why Console-only reverse

Firestore security rules **deny all client updates** to `siteSettings/emergency` once `nuclearLockdown` is already `true` — even for a Super Admin or Admin account.

That is intentional: if an attacker somehow gained a full-admin account, they still **cannot** clear lockdown from the website. Only someone with **Firebase Console** (or Admin SDK) access can reverse it.

### How to ENABLE (from the admin panel)

1. Sign in as Super Admin or Admin.
2. Open **Site Management**.
3. Read the nuclear warning carefully.
4. Confirm with a developer that they can access Firebase Console **before** enabling.
5. Enable **Nuclear Lockdown** and confirm the dialog.
6. You will be locked out of the admin UI until lockdown is reversed in Console.

### How to REVERSE (Firebase Console only — developers)

1. Open [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com) → project **`dcci-ministries`**.
2. Go to **Firestore Database**.
3. Open collection **`siteSettings`** → document **`emergency`**.
4. Find field **`nuclearLockdown`**.
5. Set it to **`false`** (boolean) and save.
6. Wait a few seconds, then hard-refresh the site and sign in again as admin.
7. Confirm Site Management shows nuclear lockdown **off**.
8. Review admin users, Auth logs, and recent deploys for the original incident.

**Do not** try to reverse lockdown by redeploying the Angular app alone — the flag lives in Firestore, not in the hosting build.

**CLI alternative** (if you use `gcloud` / Admin SDK scripts): update the same document field; client SDK writes from the browser will still be rejected by rules while lockdown is on.

## 💾 Data Loss Recovery

### **Immediate Response to Data Loss**
1. **Stop All Operations**:
   - [ ] **DO NOT make any changes** to the system
   - [ ] **Document what was lost** and when
   - [ ] **Identify the cause** if possible
   - [ ] **Preserve any remaining data**

2. **Assessment**:
   - Determine scope of data loss
   - Check if it's affecting all data or specific collections
   - Verify if it's a display issue or actual data loss

### **Recovery Procedures**
1. **Firebase Backup Restoration**:
   ```bash
   # Check available backups
   firebase firestore:backups:list
   
   # Restore from backup (if available)
   firebase firestore:backups:restore [BACKUP_ID]
   ```

2. **Manual Data Recovery**:
   - Check if data exists in different collections
   - Look for cached data in browser storage
   - Check if data exists in different environments

3. **Content Recreation**:
   - Recreate critical content from other sources
   - Use Wayback Machine if available
   - Contact content creators for original files

## 🌐 Domain & DNS Issues

### **Domain Not Resolving**

   - Try different DNS servers (8.8.8.8, 1.1.1.1)
   - Check from different locations/networks

### **SSL Certificate Issues**
1. **Check Certificate Status**:
   - Verify certificate hasn't expired
   - Check for certificate chain issues
