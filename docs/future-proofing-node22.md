# Future-Proofing for Node 22+ and Beyond 2026

## 🎯 Your Goal
You need your Ionic + Angular + Ionicons project to work smoothly beyond 2026 (even if you're still building or maintaining it solo).

## 🔍 The Problem
Node 22 broke previously stable assumptions about:
- **Web Component asset loading** (especially for icons like Ionicons)
- **import.meta.url behavior**
- **Vite/Angular dev server integration**

And those issues are not yet fully patched across Angular + Ionic + Stencil.

## ✅ The Plan: Build for the Future, Not the Past
Here's how to stay on Node 22+ and make it fully compatible — even for long-term solo development.

## ✅ Step 1: Make Node 22+ Icon Support Bulletproof
Do this once and forget it. In your `main.ts`:

```typescript
import { setAssetPath } from '@stencil/core';
setAssetPath(document.baseURI);
```

Then in `angular.json`, copy Ionicons' SVGs:

```json
{
  "glob": "**/*.svg",
  "input": "./node_modules/ionicons/dist/svg",
  "output": "svg"
}
```

This will survive any Node or Angular upgrade, because:
- You're not relying on automatic behavior
- You're explicitly preparing asset paths yourself

## ✅ Step 2: Write an npm script to automate setup
Create a script in `scripts/setup-ionicons.js`:

```javascript
import { copyFileSync, mkdirSync, readdirSync } from 'fs';
import { join } from 'path';

const src = 'node_modules/ionicons/dist/svg';
const dest = 'src/assets/svg';

mkdirSync(dest, { recursive: true });
readdirSync(src).forEach(file => {
  copyFileSync(join(src, file), join(dest, file));
});

console.log('✔ Ionicons copied to src/assets/svg');
```

Then add this to your `package.json`:

```json
"scripts": {
  "postinstall": "node scripts/setup-ionicons.js"
}
```

Now, every time you or anyone else installs dependencies, your app stays icon-safe.

## ✅ Step 3: Use the latest stable Angular & Ionic
You can and should move forward with:
- **Angular 17+** (or Angular 18 when stable)
- **Ionic 7+** (or Ionic 8 later this year)
- **Node 22**

...as long as you:
- Use `setAssetPath()` manually
- Copy SVGs yourself (like above)
- Avoid `addIcons()` unless using custom icons

## 🛡️ Bonus: Long-Term Maintenance Tips

### 🔐 Lock working versions
```bash
npm install --save-exact \
  @angular/core@17.2.x \
  @ionic/angular@7.6.x \
  ionicons@7.2.x
```

You can also use `volta` to pin Node/Yarn/NPM versions reliably across environments.

### 📦 Maintain project metadata
Make a `PROJECT_NOTES.md` with:
- Your node version
- Ionic/Angular versions
- What broke with Node 22
- What the asset copy script does

This helps future you in 2026 remember what's wired together.

## ✅ Final Recommendation
**You don't need to downgrade to Node 20**

Instead, stay on Node 22, but proactively patch the icon pipeline and document it.

This approach:
- **Future-proofs your build**
- **Avoids more breakage when LTS ends**
- **Keeps Cursor and Firebase up-to-date too**

## 🚀 Implementation Status

This project has implemented:
- ✅ `setAssetPath(document.baseURI)` in main.ts
- ✅ Ionicons SVG assets copied to build output via angular.json
- ✅ Node version locked to 20.x (can upgrade to 22+ with proper setup)
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation of all gotchas

## 📋 Next Steps for Full Future-Proofing

1. **Create the automated setup script** (`scripts/setup-ionicons.js`)
2. **Add postinstall script** to package.json
3. **Consider upgrading to Node 22** with the bulletproof setup
4. **Document any additional workarounds** in this guide
